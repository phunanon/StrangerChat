            <h3 id="terms">Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>
              These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern use of the anonymous
              matchmaking bot called StrangerChat ("the Bot") by you ("the
              User") provided by Patrick Bowen ("the Provider"), along with
              moderation staff appointed by him ("Staff"). By using the Bot, you
              agree to abide by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part
              of these Terms, you may not use the Bot.
            </p>
            <h4>1. Data Collection, Use, and Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              The Bot collects the following personal information from Users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Discord ID</li>
              <li>Discord tag</li>
              <li>Expressed gender and gender preferences</li>
              <li>Declared age in years (13-17, then 18+)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All interactions on the Bot are recorded and monitored.</p>
            <p>
              Personal information is stored securely in a database on a cloud
              server, and used solely for the purpose of providing anonymous
              conversations, matching Users based on their gender preferences,
              and assisting Staff with moderation. Conversation messages are
              stored in private Discord channels only accessible to the
              Provider, and in the Direct Messages of each chat partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reported conversations are evaluated by OpenAI technology, and the
              summarised ruling, along with select quotations, are shared with
              Staff in a private Discord channel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Messages containing double-digits, and surrounding messages, are
              also evaluated by OpenAI technology to compare ages with what was
              previously declared to the Bot, and the ruling and select
              quotations are shared with Staff in a private Discord channel. The
              Provider does not share User data with any other parties unless
              relevant to moderation. All data shared to OpenAI is not tied to
              any Discord user, and is textually stripped of Discord tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data is retained for as long as the User continues to have access
              to the Bot, and can be deleted upon request.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Premium Features and Subscription</h4>
            <p>Premium features offered by the Bot include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Priority matching with a preferred gender</li>
              <li>One final message after disconnection</li>
              <li>Notification of waiting matches</li>
              <li>Notification of ratings and blocks</li>
              <li>Chat history tracking</li>
              <li>Gifting Premium to a stranger</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cost of a Premium subscription is a minimum of £2 per month,
              payable through single payments or monthly billing cycles
              facilitated by Stripe through Ko-fi. Users can cancel their
              monthly subscription at any time through Ko-fi. No refunds are
              provided. Premium features may be updated, removed, or withheld
              from Users at any time.
            </p>
            <h4>3. User Conduct, Moderation, and Termination</h4>
            <p>
              Users must follow the rules provided by the Bot and refrain from
              any prohibited actions. Breaking these rules or engaging in
              behavior outside of the Bot that violates these Terms may result
              in the temporary suspension or permanent termination of the User's
              ability to use the bot. This includes circumventing the rules by
              using alternative accounts. Account sharing is prohibited.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Bot employs OpenAI Artificial Intelligence (AI) via a Large
              Language Model (LLM) with the ability to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Evaluate reported conversations and determine whether the
                reported user was inappropriate, obscene, or sexual.
              </li>
              <li>Automatically mute the reported User.</li>
              <li>
                Automatically and permanently move the reported User to the NSFW
                section if it is expilictly evident that within the conversation
                that they are aged 18 or above.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluate messages containing double-digits which substantially
                differ from the age the user previously declared, to determine
                if it is likely an age, what that age is (extraction), and
                considering surrounding messages to determine false-positives.
                If all these conditions are met, the User has their age
                challenged, which must be resolved with Staff.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              AI decisions are made without prior human oversight, but are fully
              audited and reversible by the Provider and Staff.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>
              Users can report conversations or contact the Provider or Staff
              directly to raise concerns or disputes. All concerns are handled
              confidentially, and discussions are not disclosed to other
              parties.
