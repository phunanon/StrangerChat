            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Respectful behavior:</b> Treat others with respect and
                kindness at all times, unless in jest and the partner knows it
                is in jest. However harassment, hate speech, or any form of
                discrimination will not be tolerated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Obtain age and consent:</b> No obscene or inappropriate
                content or conversations without the expressed consent of your
                chat partner. Users under the age of 18 are not considered to be
                able to express consent to users of the age 18 or over.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>No spamming:</b> While the bot itself does attempt to
                mitigate spam, do not try to bypass these measures. This
                includes self-promotion without the consent and interest of your
                partner.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Listen to moderators:</b> Comply with their instructions and
                decisions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>True identity:</b> You are never required to reveal your true
                identity, but you must not impersonate someone else.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Report violations:</b> If you feel your partner has violated
                any of these rules then you must report it via the bot or
                directly to moderators.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Meaningful reports:</b> Do not report someone for no reason,
                or because you simply do not like them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Compliance with Terms:</b> You must comply with the Terms of
                Service, and adhere to any updates or changes made to these
                Terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Prohibited Content:</b> Users must refrain from sharing or
                engaging in discussions involving illegal activities, obscene
                content, or any other content deemed inappropriate by the
                moderators.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Violation of any of these rules may result in the suspension or
            termination of the user's account, as outlined in the bot's terms of
            service.

            <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>
              These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern use of the anonymous
              matchmaking bot called StrangerChat ("the Bot") by you ("the
              User") provided by Patrick Bowen ("the Provider"). By using the
              Bot, you agree to abide by these Terms. If you do not agree with
              any part of these Terms, you may not use the Bot.
            </p>
            <h4>1. Data Collection and Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              The Bot collects the following personal information from Users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Discord ID</li>
              <li>Discord tag</li>
              <li>Expressed gender and gender preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All interactions on the Bot are recorded and monitored.</p>
            <p>
              This information is stored securely in a database on a cloud
              server and is used solely for the purpose of providing anonymous
              conversations, matching Users based on their gender preferences,
              and assisting with moderation. The Provider does not share User
              data with any third parties. User data is protected using
              encryption and appropriate access controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data is retained for as long as the User continues to have access
              to the Bot, including if they leave or are removed from any mutual
              Discord servers that gives them access to the Bot, and can be
              deleted upon request.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Premium Features and Subscription</h4>
            <p>Premium features offered by the Bot include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Priority matching with a preferred gender</li>
              <li>Matching only with Users of above-average reputation</li>
              <li>One final message after disconnection</li>
              <li>Notification of waiting matches</li>
              <li>Notification of ratings and blocks</li>
              <li>Chat history tracking</li>
              <li>Submission of messages to be shown to matches</li>
              <li>Gifting Premium to a stranger</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cost of a premium subscription is a minimum of ¬£2 per month,
              payable through single payments or monthly billing cycles
              facilitated by Stripe through Ko-fi. Users can cancel their
              monthly subscription at any time through Ko-fi. No refunds are
              provided.
            </p>
            <h4>3. User Conduct and Termination</h4>
            <p>
              Users must follow the rules provided by the Bot and refrain from
              any prohibited actions. Breaking these rules or engaging in
              behavior outside of the Bot that violates these Terms may result
              in the temporary suspension or permanent termination of the User's
              ability to use the bot. This includes circumventing the rules by
              using alternative accounts.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>
              Users can report conversations or contact the Provider directly to
              raise concerns or disputes. All concerns are handled
              confidentially, and discussions are not disclosed to any other
              parties.
