            <h3 id="terms">Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>
              These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern use of the anonymous
              matchmaking bot called StrangerChat ("the Bot") by you ("the
              User") provided by Patrick Bowen ("the Provider"). By using the
              Bot, you agree to abide by these Terms. If you do not agree with
              any part of these Terms, you may not use the Bot.
            </p>
            <h4>1. Data Collection and Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              The Bot collects the following personal information from Users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Discord ID</li>
              <li>Discord tag</li>
              <li>Expressed gender and gender preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All interactions on the Bot are recorded and monitored.</p>
            <p>
              This information is stored securely in a database on a cloud
              server, or in private Discord channels only accessible to
              moderators, and is used solely for the purpose of providing
              anonymous conversations, matching Users based on their gender
              preferences, and assisting with moderation. The Provider does not
              share User data with any third parties other than any appointed
              moderators. User data is protected using encryption and
              appropriate access controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data is retained for as long as the User continues to have access
              to the Bot, including if they leave or are removed from any mutual
              Discord servers that gives them access to the Bot, and can be
              deleted upon request.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Premium Features and Subscription</h4>
            <p>Premium features offered by the Bot include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Priority matching with a preferred gender</li>
              <li>Matching only with Users of above-average reputation</li>
              <li>One final message after disconnection</li>
              <li>Notification of waiting matches</li>
              <li>Notification of ratings and blocks</li>
              <li>Chat history tracking</li>
              <li>Submission of messages to be shown to matches</li>
              <li>Gifting Premium to a stranger</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cost of a Premium subscription is a minimum of ¬£2 per month,
              payable through single payments or monthly billing cycles
              facilitated by Stripe through Ko-fi. Users can cancel their
              monthly subscription at any time through Ko-fi. No refunds are
              provided. Premium features may be updated, removed, or withheld
              from Users at any time.
            </p>
            <h4>3. User Conduct and Termination</h4>
            <p>
              Users must follow the rules provided by the Bot and refrain from
              any prohibited actions. Breaking these rules or engaging in
              behavior outside of the Bot that violates these Terms may result
              in the temporary suspension or permanent termination of the User's
              ability to use the bot. This includes circumventing the rules by
              using alternative accounts.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>
              Users can report conversations or contact the Provider directly to
              raise concerns or disputes. All concerns are handled
              confidentially, and discussions are not disclosed to any other
              parties.
