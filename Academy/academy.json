{
  "topics": {
    "DMs": "By chatting directly, other staff members will be unaware of the conversation, and it might be suspected that you are abusing your position as moderator to enforce rules without oversight.",
    "Tickets": "We encourage members to open tickets in the server to resolve issues. This means they are handled by the most experienced staff (Moderators), minimising drama in server channels, and allowing Moderators to write a note about the interaction for future reference.<br />If the member is muted, their only course of action is to message the server admin, but this should be a last resort.",
    "Ombudsman": "Only the server admin can resolve issues with staff, as all other appropriate channels might be monitored or even sabotaged by the staff member in question.",
    "Anonymity": "Who speaks to who on the bot ought to be kept at the highest secrecy. The entire business model relies on people remaining anonymous to their chat partners.<br />Never, under any circumstances, share who was speaking to who with anybody else.<br />Consider that you have no idea what ulterior motives people have by asking - it might even endanger the person you deanonymise.",
    "Gratis": "If you think a Premium feature might improve somebody's experience of the bot in a positive, deserving way, then ask the server admin to grant one day's free Premium.",
    "Enforce Rule": "\"Enforce rule\" provides many benefits over traditional, direct moderation:<ul><li>It sends the offender a direct message with a quotation of the message you selected, and which rule was broken.</li><li>It enables you to delete the offending message.</li><li>It leaves a permanent note on their account, and an alert in the logs, so other staff are aware of their behaviour.</li><li>It gives the staff member enforcing the rule a bit of anonymity, making the offender less likely to argue, as they wouldn't exactly know who to argue with.</li></ul>",
    "Silent Moderation": "Wherever possible, it is good to not clutter public chats with moderation talk, letting conversation move on naturally from an incident. Try not to draw attention to users, e.g. pointing out that a certain minor is looking for adults (this would make life easier for pedos), or that somebody has a NSFW bio (this causes people to look). If a moderation decision requires deeper discussion, this must be done via tickets.",
    "Immediate Ban": "Banning is a last resort - it is difficult to undo, and wrongful bans can be rather scandalous. However, some cases warrant an immediate ban, without giving the offender a chance to appeal:<ul><li>Overtly pornographic accounts</li><li>Accounts which have sent messages about trading, AND their bio is about trading</li><li>Overt racists, pedos, gore posters</ul>",
    "Hacked Accounts": "If an account looks normal (pic, bio, perhaps regular messages in the past), but has posted an ad which looks automated, it is very likely that account has been hacked. In most cases, the person is unaware that their account is hacked, and is posting such material. Removing the material with \"Enforce rule\", then kicking the user if it happens again, allows them time to fix the issue and potentially rejoin. If you want to help them, advise that they need to log out of all accounts in settings, as that's how these hacks work.",
    "Channel Ban": "Server bans are a last resort measure, especially as members lose access to the StrangerChat bot if banned. A lighter alternative is to ban them from a specific channel they have misbehaved in. This gives them a slap on the wrist, and protects users in the topical channel from further disturbance. If possible, use the message context command for channel banning, as it provides context - else, write a manual note.",
    "Hearsay": "Be aware of hearsay between server members. Oftentimes people will believe things about another member which are unvalidated or even untrue, and tell others. Moderation requires evidence beyond reasonable doubt.",
    "Doxxing": "If you see personal information, such as a full legal name, mobile number, email address, school / work location, etc, remove it immediately. It could be their own information, or information of somebody they're trying to frame or prank, or otherwise implicate the server in serious crime.",
    "No clean hands": "Arguments happen, and sometimes there's even clear instigators of who turned them nasty. However, when staff have already told everybody to drop it, especially when action has already been taken to resolve the issue, then it doesn't matter who started it. If the original victim continues to fight after being told to stop, they too are breaking server rules.",
    "Second Chances": "Our server is rather highly moderated, with a low tolerence for bad behaviour. However, it should be recognised that not everybody whe joins is aware just how serious moderation is taken. Or, they're genuinely not aware that a certain behaviour of theirs is wrong.<br />Nobody can undo their first mistake, so it is important to inform people that they did something wrong, so that if it happens again we can be sure they consciously decided to break the rules.",
    "MobRule": "The MobRule bot was introduced as sometimes there are few Moderators online to urgently ban bad people. It allows any member to propose or vote on a ban, but at least one staff member is required to vote on it.<br />Please realise this: the public will vote on anything. It is not about doing the will of the mob, but instead providing some checks and balances in case of rouge staff. Therefore, it is up to you to NOT vote when it counts - especially as unbanning is very difficult and wrongful bans can be scandalous.",
    "17 to 18": "While 17 year olds already chat with all ages on the bot, they are still unable to access the NSFW chat. Unless their birthday is within a couple of weeks, it is better to tell them to wait until they are legally an adult.",
    "Transparency": "Staff actions should be transparent, to avoid accusations of bias or unfair treatment. If asked by a member, you should be willing to explain the actions and reasoning behind moderation actions, within the bounds of privacy and confidentiality. You do not need to reveal which staff member took the action, so long as the reasoning was sound.",
    "#mature-chat": "While discussion of mature (adult) topics is permitted in this chat, such as issues around sex, overtly sexual messages are forbidden.",
    "Deference": "There is a chain of authority in the server, starting with the mob, then Deputies, then Guards, then Moderators, then the Admin. If you feel a situation is not something you can comfortably or effectively handle, pass it up to a higher member of staff.",
    "Appeal to authority": "Never try to argue to a member that other staff members would act or believe the same as you do, especially of higher staff. It is disadvantageous to that staff member, and makes the staff team look corrupt.",
    "Take the high-road": "Do not sink to the level of the person who is arguing with you. As staff, you have powers other members don't, but you still undermine your authority - and the integrity of the whole staff team - by abusing those powers.",
    "Conflict": "Fundamentally, when people are arguing with one another, it is between themselves - the problem is when it's in a public space. Recommend to members that they block/ignore people who argue with them, or argue in DMs instead.",
    "Retroactive notes": "It is possible to leave notes on the accounts of members who have already left the server. You can use the \"Note this message\" command (near \"Enforce rule\") to do this, else you will need to obtain their Discord ID and use the /notes command with that ID.<br />This is encouraged, as members will often re-join the server, so those notes might become relevant in the future.",
    "Abuse of power": "Do not use your powers as staff to enforce rules on others for your personal matters.",
    "Baiting": "Do not rile up members so that they misbehave, which under normal circumstances would allow you to take action against them. You must realise that members become more easily inflamed when arguing with staff than other members."
